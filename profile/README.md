## node-based workflow automation for Python

iograft is a node-based processing framework and visual programming tool for workflow automation in Python. It is all about speeding up the tedious and repetitive parts of your workflows so you can spend more time actually creating content and innovating.

iograft built to integrate seamlessly with a wide variety of DCC applications and fit in with your existing workflows. Our GitHub repositories contain nodes and plugins for the applications that are currently supported, but iograft itself can work with ANY Python interpreter/API.
